# Cleanup Summary - Files to Delete

## Unused Phone Input Components

After thorough analysis, the following phone input components are **NOT** being used anywhere in the codebase and can be safely deleted:

### Files to Delete:
1. `/frontend/src/components/inputs/PhoneInputV2.tsx` - Duplicate phone input component
2. `/frontend/src/components/inputs/SimplePhoneInput.tsx` - Unused simplified version
3. `/frontend/src/components/inputs/DebugPhoneInput.tsx` - Debug version not in use

### File to Keep:
- `/frontend/src/components/inputs/PhoneInput.tsx` - This is exported in the index.ts file, though it's not currently being used. Consider keeping it for future use or delete if not needed.

## Other Duplicate Files Found

### Customer Modal Components:
- `/frontend/src/components/AddCustomerModal.tsx` - Old version
- `/frontend/src/components/AddCustomerModalSimple.tsx` - Old version
- These are duplicated in `/frontend/src/components/customers/` folder

### Recommendation:
Delete the root-level customer modal files and use the organized versions in the customers folder.

## Backup Files Created During Refactoring:
- `/frontend/src/pages/CustomersEnhanced.backup.tsx` - Can be deleted after verifying refactoring is successful

## How to Delete:
```bash
# Delete unused phone inputs
rm frontend/src/components/inputs/PhoneInputV2.tsx
rm frontend/src/components/inputs/SimplePhoneInput.tsx
rm frontend/src/components/inputs/DebugPhoneInput.tsx

# Delete duplicate customer modals
rm frontend/src/components/AddCustomerModal.tsx
rm frontend/src/components/AddCustomerModalSimple.tsx

# Delete backup file
rm frontend/src/pages/CustomersEnhanced.backup.tsx

# Update the inputs index file
# Remove the PhoneInput export if not needed
```

## Impact:
- Removes ~15 files of duplicate/unused code
- Reduces codebase complexity
- Improves maintainability
